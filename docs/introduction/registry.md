# Registry

Our open-source solution to submit and showcase wallets and dApps that support WalletConnect. You can view existing entries over at our [website](https://walletconnect.com/registry) or use [registry api](#registry-api) to fetch them programmatically.

## Submitting a project

Head over to [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) and create an account if you don't already have one. Once you sign in, simply fill out our project form under "Registry" section and submit it for review. To ensure fast approval make sure you follow our [registry submission guidelines](https://walletconnect.com/registry/guidelines). Once approved your project will automatically appear on our website and api.

If you would like to edit or claim an existing registry item, email us at support@walletconnect.com to help migrate the listing to your account.

## Registry API

The Registry API currently offers the following functionality:

- [Listings](#listings-api) - Allows for fetching of wallets and dApps listed in the [WalletConnect Cloud Registry](https://walletconnect.com/registry).
- [Logo](#logo-api) - Provides logo assets in different sizes for a given registry entry.
